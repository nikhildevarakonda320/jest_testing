# Queue Implementation with Jest Testing

A robust implementation of a Queue data structure in JavaScript with comprehensive test coverage using Jest.

## Project Overview

This project implements a Queue data structure with standard queue operations and includes thorough unit testing using Jest. The implementation achieves 100% test coverage across all metrics.

## Queue Implementation

The Queue class provides the following operations:

- `constructor()`: Creates a new empty queue
- `enqueue(item)`: Adds an item to the end of the queue
- `dequeue()`: Removes and returns the first item in the queue
- `peek()`: Returns the first item without removing it
- `isEmpty()`: Checks if the queue is empty
- `length()`: Returns the number of items in the queue
- `removeAll()`: Removes all items from the queue

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install

## Test Coverage
The implementation has 100% test coverage:

- Statements: 12/12 (100%)
- Branches: 4/4 (100%)
- Functions: 7/7 (100%)
- Lines: 12/12 (100%)
